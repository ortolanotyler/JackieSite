Welcome to part two of my experience at Walt Disney World in 2023! Over
in part one, I reviewed Walt Disney's Beach Club Resort but now let’s talk
Epcot, Magic Kingdom and Animal Kingdom! My best friend Lauren and I
had such an enchanting experiences together, and I hope this travel diary of
two 20-somethings can help you plan your Disney trip. I don’t have tips
about traveling with children, so consider this our adult 3-day guide to Walt
Disney World!
</p>

� Day 1: Epcot

</p>

� Day 1: Epcot

<p style={{ fontSize:'1.5rem', fontFamily: 'GFS Didot, serif', margin: '1rem', maxWidth:'100%' , marginLeft: '0em'}}>

We started the day by getting up early, donning our comfy but cute Disney
World attire, and picked up breakfast at the Beach Club Marketplace. As
tempting as it was to buy souvenirs right away, we decided to see all that
Epcot has to offer first! We walked about 7 minutes to the entry gates,
though you can also take the boat there as well.
</p>


<p style={{ fontSize:'1.5rem', fontFamily: 'GFS Didot, serif', margin: '1rem', maxWidth:'100%' , marginLeft: '0em'}}>

Be sure to drink lots of water and wear sunscreen if you plan to spend all
day out there - Epcot is all about walking around the world! � � � �

<p style={{ fontSize:'3rem', fontFamily: 'GFS Didot, serif', margin: '1rem', maxWidth:'100%' , marginLeft: '1em'}}>

� What does EPCOT mean?
</p>

<p style={{ fontSize:'1.5rem', fontFamily: 'GFS Didot, serif', margin: '1rem', maxWidth:'100%' , marginLeft: '0em'}}>

So… what is Epcot? Epcot is a celebration of human achievement and
cultural diversity, perfectly encapsulated in its Future World and World
Showcase. EPCOT stands for "Experimental Prototype Community of
Tomorrow.”</p>

<p style={{ fontSize:'1.5rem', fontFamily: 'GFS Didot, serif', margin: '1rem', maxWidth:'100%' , marginLeft: '0em'}}>

This is not a ride-heavy exhibit but a stunning display of various countries
around the world, celebrating architecture, culture, and food.
</p>

<p style={{ fontSize:'1.5rem', fontFamily: 'GFS Didot, serif', margin: '1rem', maxWidth:'100%' , marginLeft: '0em'}}>

Disney Characters are intertwined throughout the countries, like the Winnie
the Pooh characters in England and Anna and Elsa in Norway. In both
shrub and human form! I highly suggest Epcot for an adult audience, and if
you do like to drink alcohol, you can “drink around the world” during the
day and night. Epcot used to be unique in serving alcohol, but now all parks
offer adult beverages. Cheers!</p>

� Epcot International Flower & Garden Festival
</p>



<p style={{ fontSize:'1.5rem', fontFamily: 'GFS Didot, serif', margin: '1rem', maxWidth:'100%' , marginLeft: '0em'}}>

The best time to really take in the beauty of Epcot is during the Epcot
International Flower & Garden Festival. This year the festival is from
February 28 to May 27, 2024. The intricate Disney character topiaries, bright
floral displays and fresh delights from the pop trucks are nothing short of
magical.
</p>

<p style={{ fontSize:'1.5rem', fontFamily: 'GFS Didot, serif', margin: '1rem', maxWidth:'100%' , marginLeft: '0em'}}>
After our time at several Disney Parks, Lauren and I agree that the Food
Trucks for the International Flower and Garden Festival were the best
food at the parks. Fresh, hot, and rich with flavour. The corn was delicious,
and I crave it as I’m writing this.

</p>

<p style={{ fontSize:'1.5rem', fontFamily: 'GFS Didot, serif', margin: '1rem', maxWidth:'100%' , marginLeft: '0em'}}>
We started a meal at Chefs de France, but ended up leaving after an
appetizer as we preferred the food trucks! The festival food really was that
good.

� Pavilion Highlights!
</p>

<p style={{ fontSize:'1.5rem', fontFamily: 'GFS Didot, serif', margin: '1rem', maxWidth:'100%' , marginLeft: '0em'}}>

My highlight pavilions—France, Morocco, Japan and Italy—each told their
own unique story through architecture, cuisine, and culture, and of course -
shopping. I loved some of the higher end brands like Geurlain in the French
shop, alongside adorable Disney-themed home goods and Mickey ears
unique to each country. While many shops throughout the parks have
similar items, the country specific merchandise isn't anywhere else in the
parks.
</p>

<div>    <img src= {image1} alt = 'b1' style={{width:'100%'}}></img></div>
<div>    <img src= {image1} alt = 'b1' style={{width:'100%'}}></img></div>



<p style={{ fontSize:'1.5rem', fontFamily: 'GFS Didot, serif', margin: '1rem', maxWidth:'100%' , marginLeft: '0em'}}>
With France, you enter a Parisian neighbourhood, complete with a
stunning replica of the Eiffel Tower and charming Paris-inspired streets.
Ratatouille is heavily featured in this pavilion� .
</p>


<p style={{ fontSize:'1.5rem', fontFamily: 'GFS Didot, serif', margin: '1rem', maxWidth:'100%' , marginLeft: '0em'}}>
Next up, Morocco! The Morocco Pavilion at Epcot has detailed replicas of
Marrakesh's medinas and the Koutoubia Minaret. There is a bustling
marketplace to walk through, and Lauren and I shared fantastic meal in
Morocco at Spice Road Table. Morocco is so colourful!
</p>

<p style={{ fontSize:'1.5rem', fontFamily: 'GFS Didot, serif', margin: '1rem', maxWidth:'100%' , marginLeft: '0em'}}>
Japan’s gardens are so serene, featuring a majestic torii gate and a detailed
replica of the Katsura Imperial Villa. In the shops, you can also find
Animal Crossing plushies, Sailor Moon, Kirby and more anime
merchandise, which I was over the moon about. I didn’t expect to see any
franchises other than Disney!

</p>

<div>    <img src= {image1} alt = 'b1' style={{width:'100%'}}></img></div>

<p style={{ fontSize:'1.5rem', fontFamily: 'GFS Didot, serif', margin: '1rem', maxWidth:'100%' , marginLeft: '0em'}}>


The Italy Pavilion at Epcot recreates the beauty of Venice, featuring
detailed replicas of St. Mark's Campanile and the Doge's Palace, alongside
intricate Venetian canals and gondolas. The authentic Italian dining
experiences which sadly were booked up, (try Via Napoli and Tutto Italia)
but we had fun viewing Venetian masks and testing luxury fragrances.

❄ Frozen Ever After Ride is A Must!
</p>

<p style={{ fontSize:'1.5rem', fontFamily: 'GFS Didot, serif', margin: '1rem', maxWidth:'100%' , marginLeft: '0em'}}>
Norway is a must-see if you love Frozen. The line
for Frozen Ever After Ride at Epcot was VERY
long when we went, and if you have the budget,
getting a fast-pass truly is a game-changer for
the experience. I went later with my husband
and bit the bullet buying a "Genie+ Pass," and
WOW, what a world of difference in not having
to wait in a queue. Can’t stress this enough!
</p>


<div>    <img src= {image1} alt = 'b1' style={{width:'100%'}}></img></div>
<div>    <img src= {image1} alt = 'b1' style={{width:'100%'}}></img></div>
<div>    <img src= {image1} alt = 'b1' style={{width:'100%'}}></img></div>

<p style={{ fontSize:'1.5rem', fontFamily: 'GFS Didot, serif', margin: '1rem', maxWidth:'100%' , marginLeft: '0em'}}>

Back to the ride, Frozen Ever After is so visually
pleasing; you really do feel like you’ve entered
the world of Frozen and get the enjoy the iconic
songs.
</p>

<p style={{ fontSize:'1.5rem', fontFamily: 'GFS Didot, serif', margin: '1rem', maxWidth:'100%' , marginLeft: '0em'}}>
If you don’t know what Genie+ is, it’s a paid service at Disney World that
allows guests to reserve access to expedited lines for select attractions,
helping to significantly reduce wait times. Some rides do have an added free
when booking throughout the day, which can get pretty expensive if you are
paying if you are covering several kids passes. 
</p>

� Celebrate Technology

</p>

<p style={{ fontSize:'1.5rem', fontFamily: 'GFS Didot, serif', margin: '1rem', maxWidth:'100%' , marginLeft: '0em'}}
>
As for celebrating technology, lowimpact rides like Soarin’, Test Track,
and Mission: Earth added thrills to our
exploration, making Epcot a blend of
educational fun and adventure. Again,
none of these rides are roller-coasters
but more visual experiences.


</p>

<p style={{ fontSize:'1.5rem', fontFamily: 'GFS Didot, serif', margin: '1rem', maxWidth:'100%' , marginLeft: '0em'}}
>
Try Jeoffery’s special drinks to stay
hydrated; the space-themed drinks are
very fun and sweet.
</p>

<p style={{ fontSize:'3rem', fontFamily : 'GFS Didot, serif', margin: '  1rem', maxWidth:'100%' , marginLeft: '1em'}}>
The Most Epic Night-Show
</p>

<p style={{ fontSize:'1.5rem', fontFamily: 'GFS Didot, serif', margin: '1rem', maxWidth:'100%' , marginLeft: '0em'}}
>
Seeing Epcot at night is a must as well. There are far fewer kids, lots of
drinks and food to try. We headed back to France and got a delicious crepe
and ate by the ”The Fountain of Rats”. We stayed out until the night show,
which recently changed to a new show called 'Luminous: Symphony of
Us."

</p>


<p style={{ fontSize:'1.5rem', fontFamily: 'GFS Didot, serif', margin: '1rem', maxWidth:'100%' , marginLeft: '0em'}}
>
Expect to see a stunning light show with large water fountains, fireworks,
and music. I wouldn’t say I’m a full-blown Disney fanatic though I totally
enjoy everything Disney and I had tears in my eyes listening to the nostalgic
music! I was truly so happy to be there with my best friend and we stood
near the fence and didn’t have a problem seeing a wonderful view despite
getting there late.

</p>

<p style={{ fontSize:'1.5rem', fontFamily: 'GFS Didot, serif', margin: '1rem', maxWidth:'100%' , marginLeft: '0em'}}

After 25,000 steps (Walt Disney World is a workout), we got some sleep to
experience Magic Kingdom and Animal Kingdom the next day.

</p>

Day 2: Magic Kingdom
</p>

<p style={{ fontSize:'1.5rem', fontFamily: 'GFS Didot, serif', margin: '1rem', maxWidth:'100%' , marginLeft: '0em'}}
>
We started our day heading to the bus stop and arrived at the iconic Magic
Kingdom. Side note, but when I went to Walt Disney World with my
husband, Magic Kingdom was his least favorite park as it is the most
crowded and most “Disney princess” themed, appealing most to kids. That
being said, for a first-time Disney-goer, this is a must-do! Seeing the castle,
the characters, all the shops lined up - it's the quintessential Walt Disney
World experience of nostalgia and whimsy.
</p>

<div>    <img src= {image1} alt = 'b1' style={{width:'100%'}}></img></div>
<div>    <img src= {image1} alt = 'b1' style={{width:'100%'}}></img></div>

<p style={{ fontSize:'1.5rem', fontFamily: 'GFS Didot, serif', margin: '1rem', maxWidth:'100%' , marginLeft: '0em'}}
>
Starting our journey in Fantasyland, we ventured on Peter Pan's Flight
and The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh, embracing the magic of
these timeless stories. The lounge fly backpacks at the Magic Kingdom Gift
Shops are particularly cute!
</p>

<p style={{ fontSize:'1.5rem', fontFamily: 'GFS Didot, serif', margin: '1rem', maxWidth:'100%' , marginLeft: '0em'}}
>
Adventureland’s Pirates of the Caribbean Ride and Tomorrowland's
Space Mountain offered immersive experiences that were both exhilarating
and breathtaking! Again, a Genie+ would have elevated our experience. If
you are choosing which rides to use the fast pass on, Space Mountain is a
good one to use it on as the line gets very long.
</p>


<p style={{ fontSize:'1.5rem', fontFamily: 'GFS Didot, serif', margin: '1rem', maxWidth:'100%' , marginLeft: '0em'}}
>
We shared a massive hot dog at the Coca-Cola Refreshment Corner with a
view of the castle. It was delicious, and the atmosphere was so retro which I
personally love. We then exited the park, visiting the Main Street Shops -
the Candy Shop is a must-see!
</p>

<p style={{ fontSize:'1.5rem', fontFamily: 'GFS Didot, serif', margin: '1rem', maxWidth:'100%' , marginLeft: '0em'}}
>
Lauren and I didn’t schedule to meet any characters or watch parades,
instead we saw those experiences in passing which was just as magical for
our slightly short attention spans� . It made for more of a relaxing time.
Booking too many experiences with time slots in advance can get a little
overwhelming.

Park Hopped to Animal Kingdom: A Wild Adventure

</p>

<p style={{ fontSize:'1.5rem', fontFamily: 'GFS Didot, serif', margin: '1rem', maxWidth:'100%' , marginLeft: '0em'}}
>
We used our Park Hopper ticket to head to Animal Kingdom via bus
transportation. 
</p>
<p style={{ fontSize:'1.5rem', fontFamily: 'GFS Didot, serif', margin: '1rem', maxWidth:'100%' , marginLeft: '0em'}}
>
Unpopular opinion, but Animal Kingdom is my all-time favorite park. Its
unique blend of Disney theme park allure and zoo offers an experience that
celebrates the natural world, diverse cultures, and adventurous exploration.
Its lush, expansive setting is relaxing and enchanting, and it's typically less
crowded than Magic Kingdom, making it a great way to wind down if you're
using a Park Hopper pass.
</p>

<div>    <img src= {image1} alt = 'b1' style={{width:'100%'}}></img></div>


<p style={{ fontSize:'1.5rem', fontFamily : 'GFS Didot, serif', margin: '  1rem', maxWidth:'100%' , marginLeft: '0em'}}>
The Tree of Life is a masterpiece with intricately carved artwork of various
animals, standing a whopping 145 feet tall and 50 feet wide at its base. Live
animals surround the tree, including beautiful birds. At night, the Tree of
Life Awakening is a light and music show.

</p>

<p style={{ fontSize:'1.5rem', fontFamily : 'GFS Didot, serif', margin: '  1rem', maxWidth:'100%' , marginLeft: '0em'}}>
The park is divided into several areas, with Africa and Pandora - The
World of Avatar being my favorites.
</p>

<div>    <img src= {image1} alt = 'b1' style={{width:'100%'}}></img></div>
<div>    <img src= {image1} alt = 'b1' style={{width:'100%'}}></img></div>

<p style={{ fontSize:'1.5rem', fontFamily : 'GFS Didot, serif', margin: '  1rem', maxWidth:'100%' , marginLeft: '0em'}}>
An amazing experiences for animal lovers is the Kilimanjaro Safari ride
through the African savannah. Seeing the Harambe Wildlife Reserve from
the safari bus and getting so close to beautiful giraffes, elephants, rhinos,
ostriches, and catching a glimpse of lions was astounding. We went towards
the end of the day, and there wasn't a line at all.

⛰ Must-Do Rides!
</p>


<p style={{ fontSize:'1.5rem', fontFamily : 'GFS Didot, serif', margin: '  1rem', maxWidth:'100%' , marginLeft: '0em'}}>
One of the most thrilling rides I
went on during the trip is called
Expedition Everest. You might be
able to spot a mountain, far off in the
horizon when you're walking around
Animal Kingdom, and the coaster is
inside the mountain located in the
Asia section of the park.
</p>

<div>    <img src= {image1} alt = 'b1' style={{width:'100%'}}></img></div>


<p style={{ fontSize:'1.5rem', fontFamily : 'GFS Didot, serif', margin: '  1rem', maxWidth:'100%' , marginLeft: '0em'}}>
The high-speed roller coaster with a
Himalayan expedition theme was
much scarier and thrilling than most
Disney World rides. I won’t give away
the unexpected twists you’re in for, but if you're looking for at least one
thrilling roller coaster, this one is the best ride to get you screaming! Check
out Lauren’s face� ,
</p>

<div>    <img src= {image1} alt = 'b1' style={{width:'100%'}}></img></div>

<p style={{ fontSize:'1.5rem', fontFamily : 'GFS Didot, serif', margin: '  1rem', maxWidth:'100%' , marginLeft: '0em'}}>
The Pandora - World of Avatar section of the park is beyond expectations,
entering the alien world from James Cameron’s film with floating mountains
and bioluminescent floral plants. Another thrilling ride is Flight of Passage,
an immersive 3D flying simulator experience that transports you to Pandora.

<div>    <img src= {image1} alt = 'b1' style={{width:'100%'}}></img></div>
<div>    <img src= {image1} alt = 'b1' style={{width:'100%'}}></img></div>


</p>

<p style={{ fontSize:'1.5rem', fontFamily : 'GFS Didot, serif', margin: '  1rem', maxWidth:'100%' , marginLeft: '0em'}}>
You are “paired” with your own avatar and the experience simulates riding
on the back of a banshee through Pandora. The breathtaking visuals and the
sensation of truly flying through the world of Avatar is so hyper-real and
stunning that I teared up both times I went on the ride!


</p>

<p style = {{fontSize:'3rem', fontFamily: 'GFS Didot, serif', margin: '1rem', maxWidth:'100%', marginLeft: '1em'}}>
� Prepare for Major Wait Times - or Genie+
</p>
<p style={{ fontSize:'1.5rem', fontFamily : 'GFS Didot, serif', margin: '  1rem', maxWidth:'100%' , marginLeft: '0em'}}>
While the theme park does its best to
make the Flight of Passage queue
exciting with winding paths through
the Pandora landscapes, when
Lauren and I went, we waited close
to two hours, which was pretty
exhausting at the end of the day. So
again, I can’t stress enough, if you
can swing it, do the Genie+ and just
pay extra to walk right to the front of
the line.

</p>

<p style={{ fontSize:'1.5rem', fontFamily : 'GFS Didot, serif', margin: '  1rem', maxWidth:'100%' , marginLeft: '0em'}}>
We sadly didn't have enough time
after the long wait to do the Na'vi
River Journey, a boat ride
experience deep into a
bioluminescent rainforest, but Flight
of Passage really was an insanely cool experience I’d love to experience over
and over again. Even if you are not particularly a fan of Avatar, you’ll love it. 

</p>


<p style={{ fontSize:'1.5rem', fontFamily : 'GFS Didot, serif', margin: '  1rem', maxWidth:'100%' , marginLeft: '0em'}}>
When we exited the ride, it was nighttime, and the bioluminescence was
even more prominent in the dark! Keep in mind Animal Kingdom does
close earlier than other parks, so depending on the time of year, it might still
be light as you’re guided to exit

</p>

For dinner, we went to the largest Rainforest Café in the world, which had
an incredible gift shop. I had a great meal of steak, shrimp, and vegetables,
while observing all the beautiful fish in the aquarium all around us. See vlog
for visuals as my phone had died at the end of a long day and my iPhone is
what captured all the images in this post!

I hope you enjoyed reading my Walt Disney World experience, and a
throwback picture to my first time visiting with my family in 2002. Both
times gave me priceless memories with the people I love!

While there are tons of articles sharing the insider places to visit, you’ll find
gems even if you go into the parks without pre-planning too much.
Everywhere you look, you’ll see beauty and great food so relax and have fun.
You’ll have to share your experience with me either in the vlog channel
comments, or on the blog as I’d love to read about your visit!
