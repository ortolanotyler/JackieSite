                Welcome back to another instalment of Time Travel Tutorials, this time featuring the iconic '60s figure, Sharon Tate. A promising actress and model of the 1960s, Tate was celebrated for her roles in films like "Valley of the Dolls," captivating audiences with her talent and ethereal beauty. Her tragic and untimely death solidified her status as an era icon, profoundly influencing pop culture, fashion, and beauty standards of the 1960s. Let's celebrate the beautiful Sharon Tate by emulating her signature style, which remains influential today.
            </p>
            <p style={{ fontSize:'1.5rem', fontFamily: 'GFS Didot, serif', margin: '1rem', maxWidth:'100%' , marginLeft: '0em'}}>
Her makeup always stood out to me,
offering a perfect blend of '60s mod with a
touch of bohemian flair. Unlike the more
posh looks of the time embodied by "The
Face of the '60s" model Jean Shrimpton,
Sharon's style provides a sun-kissed, bold-
eyed look that leans more towards a
hippie/'70s inspiration, showcasing her
personal style was ahead of its time. If
you're as captivated by this makeup era and
Sharon Tate as I am, I hope you'll enjoy
this beauty breakdown.
</p>

<p style={{ fontSize:'1.5rem', fontFamily: 'GFS Didot, serif', margin: '1rem', maxWidth:'100%' , marginLeft: '0em'}}>
While I use modern products to achieve
the look, at the end of this article, we'll also
explore some products still available today
that were among Sharon Tate's favourites.

            The Essence of Sharon Tate’s Makeup</p>

</div>

<p style={{ fontSize:'1.5rem', fontFamily: 'GFS Didot, serif', margin: '1rem', maxWidth:'100%' , marginLeft: '0em'}}>
The essence of Sharon Tate's makeup embodies a timeless beauty that,
while uniquely hers, can be celebrated through inspired emulation. Her
makeup is characterized by bronzed, natural skin and captivating, deep-set
eyes accentuated with a boldly drawn cut crease. Her full, long lashes
perfectly complemented her enchanting hazel eyes. The look is completed
with subtly lined lips and a peachy nude lipstick, giving off effortless
glamour.
</p>

<p style={{ fontSize:'1.5rem', fontFamily: 'GFS Didot, serif', margin: '1rem', maxWidth:'100%' , marginLeft: '0em'}}>
The photoshoot that serves as my inspiration, taken by Orlando Suero in
1965, captures Sharon Tate's quintessential bohemian style like no other,
showcasing the very essence of her iconic beauty.

            The Cali-Girl Glow</p>


<div> <img src= {Sharon3} alt = 'b1' style={{width:'100%'}}></img></div>



<p style={{ fontSize:'1.5rem', fontFamily: 'GFS Didot, serif', margin: '1rem', maxWidth:'100%' , marginLeft: '0em'}}>
To channel that quintessential Cali girl vibe, a good starting point is a self-
tanner. My go-to self-tanning line for the body is Coco and Eve, but for the
face, I'm particularly fond of the Loving Tan Deluxe Face Tan Tinted Self-
Tanning Cream. It leaves a gorgeous sun-kissed tint to the skin even before
makeup application. Sharon Tate's skin looked very natural, so for my
recreation, I chose Charlotte Tilbury's light foundation, sheered out to
achieve that barely-there look.
</p>

<p style={{ fontSize:'1.5rem', fontFamily: 'GFS Didot, serif', margin: '1rem', maxWidth:'100%' , marginLeft: '0em'}}>
In the tutorial, I blended two different foundations, primarily to attain the
perfect shade match. However, for simplicity and effectiveness, I highly
recommend sticking with the Charlotte Tilbury foundation for that flawless,
natural finish
</p>

Sharon’s Modelesque Bone Structure</p>


<p style={{ fontSize:'1.5rem', fontFamily: 'GFS Didot, serif', margin: '1rem', maxWidth:'100%' , marginLeft: '0em'}}>
To emulate Sharon Tate's stunning bone structure, including her high
cheekbones and defined chin, sculpting with a lighter concealer is key. If
your skin tone is similar to hers, the Too Faced Born This Way Concealer in
Swan is an excellent option. However, if your skin tone differs, opt for a
concealer that's two shades lighter than your foundation.
</p>


<p style={{ fontSize:'1.5rem', fontFamily: 'GFS Didot, serif', margin: '1rem', maxWidth:'100%' , marginLeft: '0em'}}>
After enhancing the chin, jawline, area around the nose, and under the eyes
with brightness, lightly set these areas with powder before applying a
powder bronzer to finalize the sculpted look. This technique ensures a
natural yet defined finish, mirroring Sharon Tate's iconic beauty.

</p>

<p style={{ fontSize:'3rem', fontFamily: 'GFS Didot, serif', margin: '1rem', maxWidth:'100%' , marginLeft: '1em'}}>
Bronzed & Blushy
</p>

<p style={{ fontSize:'1.5rem', fontFamily: 'GFS Didot, serif', margin: '1rem', maxWidth:'100%' , marginLeft: '0em'}}>
For a natural bronze and blushed appearance, sticking with powder
products and matte formulas is the best. The Too Faced Milk Chocolate
Bronzer is an excellent choice for this purpose. Apply it beneath the
cheekbones, blending slightly onto the cheeks, across the nose, and onto the
forehead to achieve a soft, sun-kissed look.
</p>

<p style={{ fontSize:'1.5rem', fontFamily: 'GFS Didot, serif', margin: '1rem', maxWidth:'100%' , marginLeft: '0em'}}>
To enhance the effect with a touch of sunburnt realism and add depth to the
cheeks, the Rimmel London Maxi Blush in Wildcard is perfect. This product
helps to mimic that slightly flushed, vibrant look, evoking a natural radiance
and depth that complements the bronzed base beautifully.

    Sharon's Distinct Brows
</p>





<p style={{ fontSize:'1.5rem', fontFamily: 'GFS Didot, serif', margin: '1rem', maxWidth:'100%' , marginLeft: '0em'}}>
When it comes to brows, while my goal is to recreate iconic looks as closely
as possible, my brows are much fuller than Sharon Tate’s, so I've had to
adapt accordingly.
</p>

<p style={{ fontSize:'1.5rem', fontFamily: 'GFS Didot, serif', margin: '1rem', maxWidth:'100%' , marginLeft: '0em'}}>
To emulate Sharon's brow style, I recommend brushing up the front (head)
of the brows and setting them in place with a brow gel. Aim to maintain the
arch and tail of the brows rounded and relatively thin, if possible.
</p>


<p style={{ fontSize:'1.5rem', fontFamily: 'GFS Didot, serif', margin: '1rem', maxWidth:'100%' , marginLeft: '0em'}}>

Fortunately, having bangs helped me camouflage the differences between
our brow shapes, but it's essential to remember that these tutorials are
about capturing the essence of the icon's style rather than becoming their
exact duplicate. After all, our uniqueness is what truly defines us!!

Sharon’s Take on ‘60s Cut Crease Eyes
</p>

            <p style={{ fontSize:'1.5rem', fontFamily: 'GFS Didot, serif', margin: '1rem', maxWidth:'100%' , marginLeft: '0em'}}>
            Moving on to the eyes, let's craft a bold, graphic-style cut crease using a gel
brown liner to capture Sharon Tate's signature deep-set eyes, a hallmark of
her beauty. The shape we're aiming for diverges slightly from the perfect
half-moon typically associated with cut creases.

      </p>


<p style={{ fontSize:'1.5rem', fontFamily: 'GFS Didot, serif', margin: '1rem', maxWidth:'100%' , marginLeft: '0em'}}>
Begin by drawing a straight, slightly
diagonal line from the inner corner of the
eye upwards to just underneath the brow's
head. From this point, curve the line to
follow just above your natural crease,
creating a distinct and dramatic effect,
tailing downwards. So much of today’s
beauty standards feature an upturned cat
eye, but sleepy-doe eyes have such a
beautiful charm as well!
</p>

<p style={{ fontSize:'1.5rem', fontFamily: 'GFS Didot, serif', margin: '1rem', maxWidth:'100%' , marginLeft: '0em'}}>

To further enhance the cut crease and emulate the depth and dimension of
Sharon's eyes, apply a dark purple liner to the inner portion of the crease.
This adds a layer of complexity and richness to the look
</p>


<p style={{ fontSize:'1.5rem', fontFamily: 'GFS Didot, serif', margin: '1rem', maxWidth:'100%' , marginLeft: '0em'}}>

Keep the eyelid and brow bone bright to maintain a fresh, open appearance.
Finally, incorporate some deeper matte eyeshadow as a liner along the lash
line for added intensity and definition, completing the homage to Sharon
Tate's iconic eye makeup.
</p>

A Pop of Shimmer          </p>


<p style={{ fontSize:'1.5rem', fontFamily: 'GFS Didot, serif', margin: '1rem', maxWidth:'100%' , marginLeft: '0em'}}>
It was revealed in auction Sharon used a brown liner from Maybelline and a
White Revlon Eyeliner for the waterline, though in the inspiration photos
the waterline appeared more natural. I noticed, however, that underneath
the upper and lower lashes, there was a pop of light shimmer. I used a
shimmery Charlotte Tilbury pencil liner to catch the light.
</p>

Dainty, Twiggy Lashes       </p>

<p style={{ fontSize:'1.5rem', fontFamily: 'GFS Didot, serif', margin: '1rem', maxWidth:'100%' , marginLeft: '0em'}}>
Let’s create dainty Twiggy-inspired lashes - and lots of them! Add an extra
flick on the outer corners for that mesmerizing '60s flair. Sharon’s take on
Twiggy’s signature drawn-on bottom lash was more subtle, blending well
into her natural bottom lashes.
</p>
<p style={{ fontSize:'1.5rem', fontFamily: 'GFS Didot, serif', margin: '1rem', maxWidth:'100%' , marginLeft: '0em'}}>
For this look, I opted for the Kiss Looks So Natural lashes in Sultry, which
offer the perfect balance of natural beauty and dramatic enhancement. To
elevate these lashes further, we'll layer them with plenty of mascara. The Too
Faced Better Than Sex mascara is my go-to for thickening up these wispy
falsies, adding an extra dose of drama and volume.

            <p style={{ fontSize:'1.5rem', fontFamily: 'GFS Didot, serif', margin: '1rem', maxWidth:'100%' , marginLeft: '0em'}}>
            Sharon Tate's beauty regime was elegantly simple, incorporating a Max
Factor Brown liner for both her brows and lips. Surprisingly, one of her go-
to products was Vaseline! Many drugstore brands that are still available
today, such as the Maybelline Brown Eyeliner Pencil and Revlon White
Eyeliner, were used by Tate to highlight her enchanting eyes and were
showcased at auction. My personal favorite
from the ‘60s, Yardley, offered the most
exquisite pearly lipsticks, which were also a
part of Sharon’s makeup collection

</p>

<p style={{ fontSize:'1.5rem', fontFamily: 'GFS Didot, serif', margin: '1rem', maxWidth:'100%' , marginLeft: '0em'}}>
For skincare, Sharon placed her trust in Erno
Laszlo products, alongside a popular ‘60s
beauty facial steamer, and the luxurious Jovan
Mink & Pearls bath oil beads. For a closer
examination of her beauty collection, explore
the auction where her belongings were sold.

<p style={{ fontSize:'1.5rem', fontFamily: 'GFS Didot, serif', margin: '1rem', maxWidth:'100%' , marginLeft: '0em'}}>
In terms of perfumes, Sharon Tate had a fondness for fragrances, especially
Chanel No. 5 and Guerlain's Jicky. These classic scents are celebrated for
their enduring allure. For those interested, a review of Jicky fragrance is

were big hoops, emphasizing her bohemian
and effortlessly chic aesthetic.
